## Multiplying Algebraic Expressions

When multiplying algebraic expressions we apply the **distributive property** and collect like terms.

### Monomial x Binomial

a(b + c) = ab + ac

**Example:** 3x(2x - 5) = 6x^2 - 15x

### Binomial x Binomial (FOIL)

(a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd

**Example:** (2x + 3)(x - 4) = 2x^2 - 8x + 3x - 12 = 2x^2 - 5x - 12

### Squaring a Binomial

(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2

**Example:** (3x + 2)^2 = 9x^2 + 12x + 4

### Product of Sum and Difference

(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2

**Example:** (5x + 3)(5x - 3) = 25x^2 - 9

## Simplification

To simplify an algebraic expression:
1. Expand all products.
2. Collect like terms (terms with the same variable raised to the same power).
3. Write the answer in descending powers.

**Example:** Simplify (x + 2)(x - 3) + 2x(x + 1)
= x^2 - 3x + 2x - 6 + 2x^2 + 2x
= 3x^2 + x - 6`,

        title: "Factorisation Techniques",
        type: "text",
        order: 2,
        content: `# Factorisation

Factorisation is the reverse of expansion. We write an expression as a product of its factors.

## 1. Highest Common Factor (HCF)

Look for the greatest factor common to every term.

**Example:** 6x^3 + 9x^2 = 3x^2(2x + 3)

## 2. Difference of Two Squares

a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)

**Example:** 4x^2 - 25 = (2x + 5)(2x - 5)

## 3. Trinomials of the Form x^2 + bx + c

Find two numbers that multiply to c and add to b.

**Example:** x^2 + 7x + 12 = (x + 3)(x + 4)   because 3 x 4 = 12 and 3 + 4 = 7

## 4. Trinomials of the Form ax^2 + bx + c (a not equal to 1)

Use grouping or trial and error.

**Example:** 2x^2 + 7x + 3
Find two numbers that multiply to 2 x 3 = 6 and add to 7: those are 6 and 1.
= 2x^2 + 6x + x + 3
= 2x(x + 3) + 1(x + 3)
= (2x + 1)(x + 3)

## 5. Factorisation by Grouping

Group terms in pairs and factor each pair, then extract the common binomial.

**Example:** x^3 + x^2 + 2x + 2
= x^2(x + 1) + 2(x + 1)
= (x^2 + 2)(x + 1)

## Always check your answer by expanding the factored form.`,

## Simplifying a Single Fraction

1. Factorise the numerator and denominator completely.
2. Cancel common factors.

**Example:** (x^2 - 9) / (x^2 + 5x + 6)
= (x + 3)(x - 3) / ((x + 2)(x + 3))
= (x - 3) / (x + 2),  where x is not equal to -3

## Adding and Subtracting Algebraic Fractions

1. Find the Lowest Common Denominator (LCD).
2. Rewrite each fraction with the LCD.
3. Add or subtract the numerators.
4. Simplify if possible.

**Example:** 3/(x + 1) + 2/(x - 1)
LCD = (x + 1)(x - 1)
= 3(x - 1)/((x + 1)(x - 1)) + 2(x + 1)/((x + 1)(x - 1))
= (3x - 3 + 2x + 2) / ((x + 1)(x - 1))
= (5x - 1) / (x^2 - 1)

## Multiplying and Dividing Algebraic Fractions

- Multiply: factorise, cancel, then multiply numerators and denominators.
- Divide: invert the second fraction and multiply.`,

For a, b not equal to 0 and m, n integers:

## The Seven Laws

| Law | Rule |
|-----|------|
| Product rule | a^m * a^n = a^(m+n) |
| Quotient rule | a^m / a^n = a^(m-n) |
| Power of a power | (a^m)^n = a^(m*n) |
| Power of a product | (ab)^n = a^n * b^n |
| Power of a quotient | (a/b)^n = a^n / b^n |
| Zero exponent | a^0 = 1 |
| Negative exponent | a^(-n) = 1/a^n |

## Examples

1. 2^3 * 2^4 = 2^7 = 128
2. x^5 / x^2 = x^3
3. (3^2)^3 = 3^6 = 729
4. (2x)^3 = 8x^3
5. 5^(-2) = 1/25

## Prime Factorisation

Express numbers as products of primes before applying laws.

**Example:** Simplify 12^2 * 3^(-1)
= (2^2 * 3)^2 * 3^(-1)
= 2^4 * 3^2 * 3^(-1)
= 16 * 3

A rational exponent is a fraction: a^(m/n) = n-th root of (a^m).

## Key Definitions

- a^(1/2) = square root of a
- a^(1/3) = cube root of a
- a^(m/n) = (n-th root of a)^m = n-th root of (a^m)

## Examples

1. 8^(1/3) = cube root of 8 = 2
2. 16^(3/4) = (4th root of 16)^3 = 2^3 = 8
3. 27^(2/3) = (cube root of 27)^2 = 3^2 = 9

## Simplification Strategy

When simplifying expressions with exponents:
1. Convert roots to rational exponents.
2. Express all bases as prime factors.
3. Apply the exponent laws.
4. Simplify and give answers with positive exponents.

**Example:** Simplify (2^3 * 4^2) / 8^2
= (2^3 * (2^2)^2) / (2^3)^2
= (2^3 * 2^4) / 2^6
= 2^7 / 2^6

An exponential equation has the variable in the exponent.

## Strategy: Equal Bases

If a^x = a^y, then x = y (for a > 0, a not equal to 1).

### Steps
1. Express both sides with the same base.
2. Set the exponents equal.
3. Solve the resulting equation.

## Examples

**Example 1:** Solve 2^x = 16
2^x = 2^4, so x = 4

**Example 2:** Solve 3^(x+1) = 27
3^(x+1) = 3^3, so x + 1 = 3, therefore x = 2

**Example 3:** Solve 5^(2x) = 1/25
5^(2x) = 5^(-2), so 2x = -2, therefore x = -1

**Example 4:** Solve 4^x = 8
(2^2)^x = 2^3
2^(2x) = 2^3
2x = 3, therefore x = 3/2

## Special Cases

- a^x = 1 means x = 0 (for any base a not equal to 0)
- a^x = a means x = 1`,

## Linear Equations

A linear equation has the variable to the first power. The goal is to isolate the variable.

**Example:** Solve 3x - 7 = 2x + 5
3x - 2x = 5 + 7
x = 12

**With fractions:** Solve x/3 + 2 = x/2 - 1
Multiply by LCD (6): 2x + 12 = 3x - 6
12 + 6 = 3x - 2x
x = 18

## Quadratic Equations (by Factoring)

A quadratic equation has the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.

### Steps:
1. Write the equation in standard form (= 0).
2. Factorise the expression.
3. Set each factor equal to zero.
4. Solve for x.

**Example 1:** Solve x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0
(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0
x = 2 or x = 3

**Example 2:** Solve 2x^2 + 3x = 0
x(2x + 3) = 0
x = 0 or x = -3/2

**Example 3:** Solve x^2 = 9
x^2 - 9 = 0
(x + 3)(x - 3) = 0
x = -3 or x = 3`,

        content: `# Simultaneous Equations

Two equations with two unknowns are solved together. At Grade 10 level both equations are linear.

## Method 1: Substitution

1. Solve one equation for one variable.
2. Substitute into the other equation.
3. Solve, then back-substitute.

**Example:** Solve y = 2x + 1 and 3x + y = 11
Substitute: 3x + (2x + 1) = 11
5x + 1 = 11
5x = 10
x = 2, so y = 2(2) + 1 = 5

## Method 2: Elimination

1. Multiply equations to match a coefficient.
2. Add or subtract to eliminate one variable.

**Example:** Solve 2x + 3y = 12 and x - 3y = -3
Add the equations: 3x = 9, so x = 3.
Substitute: 2(3) + 3y = 12, so 3y = 6, y = 2.

# Literal Equations (Changing the Subject)

Rearrange a formula to make a different variable the subject.

**Example 1:** Make r the subject of A = pi * r^2
r^2 = A / pi
r = sqrt(A / pi)   (r > 0)

**Example 2:** Make t the subject of v = u + at
v - u = at
t = (v - u) / a`,

        content: `# Linear Inequalities

A linear inequality uses <, >, <=, or >= instead of =.

## Solving Rules

- Add or subtract the same value on both sides (sign unchanged).
- Multiply or divide by a **positive** number (sign unchanged).
- Multiply or divide by a **negative** number: **reverse the inequality sign**.

**Example 1:** Solve 2x + 3 > 7
2x > 4
x > 2

**Example 2:** Solve -3x + 6 <= 12
-3x <= 6
x >= -2   (sign reversed because we divided by -3)

## Number Line Representation

- Use an **open circle** (or hollow dot) for < or > (value not included).
- Use a **closed circle** (or filled dot) for <= or >= (value included).
- Shade the line in the direction of all valid values.

**Example:** x > 2 is shown with an open circle at 2 and shading to the right.
x <= -1 is shown with a closed circle at -1 and shading to the left.

## Interval Notation

- x > 2: (2; infinity)
- x <= -1: (-infinity; -1]
- -3 < x <= 5: (-3; 5]

## Double Inequalities

Subtract 3: -4 < 2x <= 6
Divide by 2: -2 < x <= 3`,

## What is a Sequence?

A **sequence** is an ordered list of numbers following a rule. Each number is called a **term**.

We label terms: T_1 (first term), T_2 (second term), T_3 (third term), and so on.

## Linear Sequences

A sequence is **linear** if there is a **constant difference** (d) between consecutive terms.

d = T_2 - T_1 = T_3 - T_2 = T_4 - T_3 = ...

### Example 1
Sequence: 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, ...
Differences: 3, 3, 3, 3
d = 3 (constant), so this is a linear sequence.

### Example 2
Sequence: 20, 15, 10, 5, 0, ...
Differences: -5, -5, -5, -5
d = -5 (constant), so this is a linear sequence with a negative difference.

### Example 3
Sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...
Differences: 2, 4, 8
The difference is not constant, so this is NOT a linear sequence.

## Generating Terms

Given the first term (a) and common difference (d), the next terms are:
T_1 = a
T_2 = a + d
T_3 = a + 2d
T_4 = a + 3d`,

        content: `# Finding the General Term

## The Formula

For a linear sequence with first term a and common difference d:

**T_n = a + (n - 1)d**

This can be rewritten as: T_n = dn + (a - d)

In the form T_n = An + B, where A = d and B = a - d.

## Example 1

Sequence: 4, 7, 10, 13, ...
a = 4, d = 3
T_n = 4 + (n - 1)(3) = 4 + 3n - 3 = 3n + 1

Check: T_1 = 3(1) + 1 = 4. T_2 = 3(2) + 1 = 7. Correct.

## Example 2

Sequence: 20, 15, 10, 5, ...
a = 20, d = -5
T_n = 20 + (n - 1)(-5) = 20 - 5n + 5 = -5n + 25

Check: T_1 = -5(1) + 25 = 20. T_3 = -5(3) + 25 = 10. Correct.

## Finding a Specific Term

**Example:** In the sequence 3, 8, 13, 18, ..., find T_20.
d = 5, a = 3
T_n = 3 + (n - 1)(5) = 5n - 2
T_20 = 5(20) - 2 = 98

## Finding Which Term Has a Given Value

**Example:** Which term of 4, 7, 10, 13, ... equals 61?
T_n = 3n + 1 = 61
3n = 60
n = 20
So T_20 = 61.`,

## What is a Function?

A function is a rule that assigns each input (x) exactly one output (y). We write f(x) to denote the output of function f for input x.

**Domain:** the set of all valid x-values (inputs).
**Range:** the set of all possible y-values (outputs).

## Linear Functions: y = mx + c

**Shape:** a straight line.

| Parameter | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| m (gradient) | m > 0 line rises left to right; m < 0 line falls left to right; m = 0 horizontal line |
| c (y-intercept) | The point where the line crosses the y-axis: (0, c) |

**Domain:** x is any real number.
**Range:** y is any real number (unless m = 0, then range = {c}).

**Example:** y = 2x - 3
Gradient = 2 (positive slope, rises), y-intercept at (0, -3).
x-intercept: 0 = 2x - 3, so x = 3/2, giving the point (3/2, 0).

## Quadratic Functions: y = ax^2 + q

**Shape:** a parabola with axis of symmetry along the y-axis (x = 0).

| Parameter | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| a > 0 | Parabola opens upward ("smile") |
| a < 0 | Parabola opens downward ("frown") |
| Larger |a| | Narrower parabola |
| Smaller |a| | Wider parabola |
| q > 0 | Graph shifts q units up |
| q < 0 | Graph shifts q units down |

**Turning point:** (0, q).
**Axis of symmetry:** x = 0.
**Domain:** x is any real number.
**Range:** y >= q (if a > 0) or y <= q (if a < 0).

**Example:** y = 2x^2 - 8
Turning point: (0, -8). Opens up. y-intercept: (0, -8).
x-intercepts: 0 = 2x^2 - 8, so x^2 = 4, x = -2 or x = 2.`,

        title: "Hyperbolic and Exponential Functions",
        type: "text",
        order: 2,
        content: `# Hyperbolic and Exponential Functions

## Hyperbolic Functions: y = a/x + q

**Shape:** two separate curves (a hyperbola) in opposite quadrants.

**Asymptotes:**
- Vertical asymptote: x = 0 (the y-axis)
- Horizontal asymptote: y = q

| Parameter | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| a > 0 | Curves in quadrants 1 and 3 (above q in Q1, below q in Q3) |
| a < 0 | Curves in quadrants 2 and 4 |
| q | Shifts the graph up (q > 0) or down (q < 0) |

**Domain:** x is any real number except 0.
**Range:** y is any real number except q.

**Example:** y = 4/x + 1
Horizontal asymptote: y = 1. Vertical asymptote: x = 0.
When x = 2: y = 4/2 + 1 = 3. When x = -2: y = 4/(-2) + 1 = -1.

## Exponential Functions: y = ab^x + q

**Shape:** a curve that increases or decreases rapidly.

**Key features:**
- Horizontal asymptote: y = q
- y-intercept: (0, a + q) since b^0 = 1

| Parameter | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| a > 0 and b > 1 | Increasing (growth) curve above y = q |
| a > 0 and 0 < b < 1 | Decreasing (decay) curve above y = q |
| a < 0 | Reflected below the asymptote y = q |
| q | Shifts the graph up or down |

**Domain:** x is any real number.
**Range:** y > q (if a > 0) or y < q (if a < 0).

**Example:** y = 2^x - 1
Asymptote: y = -1. y-intercept: (0, 2^0 - 1) = (0, 0).
When x = 3: y = 8 - 1 = 7. When x = -1: y = 1/2 - 1 = -1/2.`,

        type: "text",
        order: 3,
        content: `# Sketching and Interpreting Graphs

## Steps for Sketching Any Function

1. Identify the **type** of function (linear, quadratic, hyperbolic, exponential).
2. Find the **y-intercept** (set x = 0).
3. Find the **x-intercept(s)** (set y = 0), if applicable.
4. Identify **asymptotes** (for hyperbola and exponential).
5. Identify the **turning point** (for parabola).
6. Determine the **domain and range**.
7. Plot key points and draw a smooth curve.

## Reading Information from Graphs

Given a graph, you should be able to:
- Determine the equation by identifying a, q, m, or c.
- Read off intercepts, turning points, and asymptotes.
- Determine where f(x) > 0, f(x) < 0, f(x) = g(x).

## Determining Equations from Graphs

**Linear:** Identify two points on the line, find gradient m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1), then use y = mx + c.

**Quadratic (y = ax^2 + q):** Read the turning point (0, q) from the graph, then substitute another point to find a.

**Hyperbolic (y = a/x + q):** Read the horizontal asymptote for q, then substitute a known point to find a.

**Exponential (y = ab^x + q):** Read the asymptote for q, then use two points to find a and b.

## Intersections of Graphs

To find where f(x) = g(x), set the equations equal and solve. The solutions give the x-coordinates of the intersection points.`,

## Formula

**A = P(1 + in)**

Where:
- **A** = accumulated (final) amount
- **P** = principal (initial amount)
- **i** = interest rate per period (as a decimal, e.g. 8% = 0.08)
- **n** = number of time periods (usually years)

The **interest earned** is: I = P * i * n = A - P

## Key Feature

With simple interest, the interest is calculated on the **original principal only**. The interest earned each year is the same.

## Examples

**Example 1:** R5 000 is invested at 8% simple interest per year for 3 years.
A = 5000(1 + 0.08 * 3) = 5000(1.24) = R6 200
Interest earned = R6 200 - R5 000 = R1 200

**Example 2:** Find the time needed for R2 000 to grow to R2 600 at 10% simple interest.
2600 = 2000(1 + 0.10 * n)
1.3 = 1 + 0.1n
0.3 = 0.1n
n = 3 years

## Hire Purchase

Hire purchase is a way of buying goods on credit. Simple interest is charged on the full cash price.

**Example:** A laptop costs R12 000 cash. On hire purchase, a 10% deposit is required and the balance is paid over 2 years at 15% simple interest per year.
Deposit = 10% of R12 000 = R1 200
Balance = R12 000 - R1 200 = R10 800
A = 10 800(1 + 0.15 * 2) = 10 800(1.30) = R14 040
Monthly payment = R14 040 / 24 = R585
Total paid = R1 200 + R14 040 = R15 240`,
      },
      {
        title: "Compound Interest, Inflation, and Exchange Rates",
        type: "text",
        order: 2,
        content: `# Compound Interest

## Formula

**A = P(1 + i)^n**

Where:
- **A** = accumulated amount
- **P** = principal
- **i** = interest rate per compounding period (as a decimal)
- **n** = number of compounding periods

## Key Feature

With compound interest, interest is calculated on the principal **plus previously accumulated interest**. This produces exponential growth.

## Example

R5 000 is invested at 8% compound interest per year for 3 years.
A = 5000(1 + 0.08)^3 = 5000(1.08)^3 = 5000(1.259712) = R6 298.56
Compare with simple interest: R6 200. Compound interest earns R98.56 more.

## Simple vs Compound Interest

| Feature | Simple | Compound |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Interest on | Original amount only | Accumulated amount |
| Growth | Linear | Exponential |
| Formula | A = P(1 + in) | A = P(1 + i)^n |

## Inflation

Inflation uses the compound interest formula to calculate how prices increase over time.

**Example:** A loaf of bread costs R18 now. If inflation averages 6% per year, what will it cost in 5 years?
A = 18(1 + 0.06)^5 = 18(1.3382256) = R24.09

## Population Growth

Population growth also follows the compound formula.

**Example:** A town has 50 000 people. If the population grows at 2.5% per year, what will it be in 10 years?
A = 50000(1.025)^10 = 50000(1.2800845) = 64 004

## Currency Exchange Rates

An exchange rate tells you how much of one currency equals another.

**Example:** If 1 USD = R18.50, how many rand is $250?
R = 250 * 18.50 = R4 625

How many dollars is R10 000?
$ = 10 000 / 18.50 = $540.54`,

**d = sqrt((x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2)**

**Example:** Distance between (1, 2) and (4, 6):
d = sqrt((4-1)^2 + (6-2)^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5

## Midpoint Formula

The midpoint M of segment AB:

**M = ((x_1 + x_2)/2, (y_1 + y_2)/2)**

**Example:** Midpoint of (2, 3) and (8, 7):
M = ((2+8)/2, (3+7)/2) = (5, 5)

## Gradient (Slope) Formula

The gradient m of line AB:

**m = (y_2 - y_1) / (x_2 - x_1)**

**Example:** Gradient between (1, 3) and (5, 11):
m = (11 - 3) / (5 - 1) = 8/4 = 2

### Special Cases
- Horizontal line: m = 0 (y-values are equal)
- Vertical line: m is undefined (x-values are equal)
- Positive gradient: line rises from left to right
- Negative gradient: line falls from left to right`,

## Forms of the Equation

### Gradient-Intercept Form
**y = mx + c**
where m = gradient and c = y-intercept.

### Two-Point Form
Given points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2):
**y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)** where m = (y_2 - y_1)/(x_2 - x_1)

## Finding the Equation

**Example 1:** Gradient m = 3, passes through (2, 5).
y - 5 = 3(x - 2)
y = 3x - 6 + 5
y = 3x - 1

**Example 2:** Passes through (1, 4) and (3, 10).
m = (10 - 4)/(3 - 1) = 6/2 = 3
y - 4 = 3(x - 1)
y = 3x + 1

- Horizontal line through (a, b): y = b (gradient = 0)
- Vertical line through (a, b): x = a (gradient undefined)`,

        content: `# Parallel Lines, Perpendicular Lines, and Inclination

## Parallel Lines

Two lines are **parallel** if and only if they have the **same gradient**:
m_1 = m_2

**Example:** y = 2x + 3 and y = 2x - 7 are parallel (both have m = 2).

## Perpendicular Lines

Two lines are **perpendicular** if and only if:
**m_1 * m_2 = -1**

Equivalently: m_2 = -1/m_1

**Example:** y = 2x + 1 and y = -1/2 x + 4 are perpendicular because 2 * (-1/2) = -1.

## Inclination of a Line

The **inclination** (theta) is the angle the line makes with the positive x-axis, measured counter-clockwise.

**tan(theta) = m**

So theta = arctan(m), where 0 <= theta < 180.

### Cases:
- If m > 0: theta is an acute angle (0 < theta < 90)
- If m = 0: theta = 0 (horizontal line)
- If m < 0: theta is obtuse (90 < theta < 180). Calculate using theta = 180 + arctan(m)

**Example:** A line with gradient m = 1.
tan(theta) = 1, so theta = 45.

**Example:** A line with gradient m = -1.
tan(theta) = -1, so theta = 180 - 45 = 135.`,

## Definitions in a Right-Angled Triangle

For an angle theta in a right-angled triangle:

- **sin(theta)** = opposite / hypotenuse
- **cos(theta)** = adjacent / hypotenuse
- **tan(theta)** = opposite / adjacent

Memory aid: **SOH-CAH-TOA**

## Reciprocal Ratios

- **cosec(theta)** = 1/sin(theta) = hypotenuse / opposite
- **sec(theta)** = 1/cos(theta) = hypotenuse / adjacent
- **cot(theta)** = 1/tan(theta) = adjacent / opposite

## Special Angles

| Angle | sin | cos | tan |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 30 | 1/2 | sqrt(3)/2 | 1/sqrt(3) |
| 45 | sqrt(2)/2 | sqrt(2)/2 | 1 |
| 60 | sqrt(3)/2 | 1/2 | sqrt(3) |
| 90 | 1 | 0 | undefined |

These values come from two special triangles:
- The **45-45-90** triangle (isosceles right triangle) with sides 1, 1, sqrt(2).
- The **30-60-90** triangle with sides 1, sqrt(3), 2.

## Example

In a right triangle, the opposite side to theta is 3 and the hypotenuse is 5.
sin(theta) = 3/5 = 0.6
The adjacent side = sqrt(5^2 - 3^2) = sqrt(16) = 4
cos(theta) = 4/5 = 0.8
tan(theta) = 3/4 = 0.75`,

        type: "text",
        order: 2,
        content: `# Solving Right-Angled Triangles

## Finding a Side

Given an angle and one side, use the appropriate ratio to find the unknown side.

**Example:** In triangle ABC, angle B = 90, angle A = 35, and BC = 8.
We need AB (adjacent to angle A) and AC (hypotenuse).
tan(35) = BC / AB = 8 / AB
AB = 8 / tan(35) = 8 / 0.7002 = 11.42

## Finding an Angle

Given two sides, use the inverse trig function to find the angle.

**Example:** opposite = 6, adjacent = 8.
tan(theta) = 6/8 = 0.75
theta = arctan(0.75) = 36.87 degrees

## Solving Trigonometric Equations

At Grade 10 level, solve equations for 0 <= theta <= 90 (first quadrant).

**Example 1:** Solve sin(theta) = 0.5
theta = arcsin(0.5) = 30 degrees

**Example 2:** Solve 2cos(theta) - 1 = 0
cos(theta) = 1/2
theta = 60 degrees

**Example 3:** Solve tan(theta) = sqrt(3)
theta = 60 degrees

## The Area Rule

The area of any triangle (not just right-angled) with sides a and b and included angle C:

**Area = (1/2) * a * b * sin(C)**

**Example:** Find the area of a triangle with sides 7 cm and 10 cm and an included angle of 50 degrees.
Area = (1/2)(7)(10)sin(50) = 35 * 0.766 = 26.81 cm^2`,

- **Range:** all real numbers

## Effects of Parameters

For y = a * sin(x) + q:
- |a| changes the **amplitude** (vertical stretch)
- q shifts the graph **vertically**

For y = sin(bx):
- b changes the **period** to 360/b degrees

**Example:** y = 2sin(x) - 1 has amplitude 2, shifted down 1 unit. Range: -3 <= y <= 1.`,

## Types of Triangles

| Type | Properties |
|------|-----------|
| **Scalene** | All sides different, all angles different |
| **Isosceles** | Two sides equal, base angles equal |
| **Equilateral** | All sides equal, all angles = 60 degrees |
| **Right-angled** | One angle = 90 degrees |

## Key Triangle Properties

- The sum of the interior angles of a triangle = 180 degrees.
- The exterior angle of a triangle = the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.
- The longest side is opposite the largest angle.
- The triangle inequality: the sum of any two sides > the third side.

## Congruence of Triangles

Two triangles are **congruent** if they are identical in shape and size (all corresponding sides and angles are equal).

### Conditions for Congruence

| Condition | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **SSS** | Three sides of one triangle equal three sides of the other |
| **SAS** | Two sides and the included angle are equal |
| **ASA** (or AAS) | Two angles and a corresponding side are equal |
| **RHS** | Right angle, hypotenuse, and one other side are equal |

**Example:** In triangles ABC and DEF, if AB = DE, angle A = angle D, and AC = DF, then triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF (SAS).

## Writing Congruence Proofs

1. State the two triangles being compared.
2. List the matching sides/angles with reasons.
3. State the congruence condition (SSS, SAS, ASA, or RHS).
4. Conclude with the congruence statement (vertices in matching order).`,

        content: `# Similarity

## What is Similarity?

Two figures are **similar** if they have the same shape but not necessarily the same size.

For triangles, similarity means:
- All corresponding angles are equal.
- All corresponding sides are in the same ratio (proportional).

### Conditions for Similarity of Triangles

| Condition | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **AAA** (or AA) | All three angles of one triangle equal all three of the other |
| **SSS (proportional)** | All three pairs of corresponding sides are in the same ratio |
| **SAS (proportional)** | Two pairs of sides in the same ratio and the included angles equal |

**Example:** If triangle ABC has angles 50, 60, 70 and triangle DEF has angles 50, 60, 70, then triangle ABC is similar to triangle DEF (AAA).

If the ratio of corresponding sides is k, then:
- Corresponding sides: side_DEF = k * side_ABC
- Areas: area_DEF = k^2 * area_ABC

# The Midpoint Theorem

**Statement:** The line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and equal to half its length.

If D is the midpoint of AB and E is the midpoint of AC, then:
- DE is parallel to BC
- DE = (1/2) * BC

**Converse:** If a line is drawn through the midpoint of one side of a triangle, parallel to another side, it bisects the third side.

**Example:** In triangle ABC, D is the midpoint of AB and E is the midpoint of AC. If BC = 12 cm, then DE = 6 cm and DE is parallel to BC.`,

## Perimeter

The perimeter is the total distance around the outside of a shape.

| Shape | Perimeter Formula |
|-------|------------------|
| Square (side s) | P = 4s |
| Rectangle (l x w) | P = 2(l + w) |
| Triangle (sides a, b, c) | P = a + b + c |
| Circle (radius r) | Circumference C = 2 * pi * r |

## Area

| Shape | Area Formula |
|-------|-------------|
| Square | A = s^2 |
| Rectangle | A = l * w |
| Triangle | A = (1/2) * base * height |
| Parallelogram | A = base * height |
| Trapezium | A = (1/2)(a + b) * h, where a and b are parallel sides |
| Rhombus | A = (1/2) * d_1 * d_2, where d_1, d_2 are diagonals |
| Kite | A = (1/2) * d_1 * d_2 |
| Circle | A = pi * r^2 |

## Examples

**Rectangle:** length = 8 m, width = 5 m.
P = 2(8 + 5) = 26 m. A = 8 * 5 = 40 m^2.

**Triangle:** base = 10 cm, height = 6 cm.
A = (1/2)(10)(6) = 30 cm^2.

**Circle:** radius = 7 cm.
C = 2 * pi * 7 = 14pi = 43.98 cm. A = pi * 49 = 153.94 cm^2.`,

## Formulae

| Object | Surface Area | Volume |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Rectangular prism (l, w, h) | SA = 2(lw + lh + wh) | V = l * w * h |
| Cube (side s) | SA = 6s^2 | V = s^3 |
| Cylinder (r, h) | SA = 2 * pi * r^2 + 2 * pi * r * h | V = pi * r^2 * h |
| Cone (r, h, slant l) | SA = pi * r^2 + pi * r * l | V = (1/3) * pi * r^2 * h |
| Square pyramid (base s, slant l, h) | SA = s^2 + 2 * s * l | V = (1/3) * s^2 * h |
| Sphere (r) | SA = 4 * pi * r^2 | V = (4/3) * pi * r^3 |

Note: For cones and pyramids, the slant height l and the perpendicular height h are different. They are related by:
l = sqrt(r^2 + h^2) for a cone.

## Examples

**Cylinder:** r = 3 cm, h = 10 cm.
V = pi(3)^2(10) = 90pi = 282.74 cm^3.
SA = 2pi(9) + 2pi(3)(10) = 18pi + 60pi = 78pi = 245.04 cm^2.

**Sphere:** r = 5 cm.
V = (4/3)pi(5)^3 = (4/3)pi(125) = (500/3)pi = 523.60 cm^3.
SA = 4pi(25) = 100pi = 314.16 cm^2.

**Cone:** r = 4 cm, h = 3 cm, l = sqrt(16 + 9) = 5 cm.
V = (1/3)pi(16)(3) = 16pi = 50.27 cm^3.
SA = pi(16) + pi(4)(5) = 16pi + 20pi = 36pi = 113.10 cm^2.`,

## Unit Conversions

### Length
1 km = 1 000 m
1 m = 100 cm
1 cm = 10 mm

### Area (square the linear factor)
1 m^2 = 10 000 cm^2 (100^2)
1 cm^2 = 100 mm^2 (10^2)
1 km^2 = 1 000 000 m^2 (1000^2)

### Volume (cube the linear factor)
1 m^3 = 1 000 000 cm^3 (100^3)
1 cm^3 = 1 000 mm^3 (10^3)
1 litre = 1 000 cm^3 = 1 000 ml
1 m^3 = 1 000 litres

## Effect of Scaling

When all dimensions of an object are multiplied by a scale factor k:

| Measurement | Factor |
|-------------|--------|
| Length | Multiplied by k |
| Area (surface area) | Multiplied by k^2 |
| Volume | Multiplied by k^3 |

### Example

A cube has side 2 cm. If all dimensions are doubled (k = 2):
- Original: V = 8 cm^3, SA = 24 cm^2
- Scaled: side = 4 cm, V = 64 cm^3 = 8 * 8 (k^3 = 8 times), SA = 96 cm^2 = 4 * 24 (k^2 = 4 times)

### Practical Application

A model of a building is built at a scale of 1:50.
- If the model is 30 cm tall, the real building is 30 * 50 = 1 500 cm = 15 m tall.
- If the model floor area is 200 cm^2, the real floor area is 200 * 50^2 = 500 000 cm^2 = 50 m^2.
- If the model volume is 6 000 cm^3, the real volume is 6 000 * 50^3 = 750 000 000 cm^3 = 750 m^3.`,

        content: `# Measures of Central Tendency

## Mean

The **mean** (average) is the sum of all values divided by the number of values.

Mean = (sum of all values) / (number of values)

**Example:** Data: 4, 6, 8, 12. Mean = (4 + 6 + 8 + 12) / 4 = 30/4 = 7.5

### Estimated Mean for Grouped Data
For grouped data, use class midpoints:
Estimated mean = sum(frequency * midpoint) / sum(frequency)

## Median

The **median** is the middle value when data is arranged in order.
- Odd number of values: the middle one.
- Even number of values: the average of the two middle values.

**Example:** Data: 3, 5, 9, 11, 15. Median = 9 (third of five values).
Data: 2, 4, 6, 8. Median = (4 + 6)/2 = 5.

## Mode

The **mode** is the value that occurs most frequently. A data set can have no mode, one mode, or multiple modes.

**Example:** Data: 2, 4, 4, 6, 7. Mode = 4.

# Measures of Dispersion

## Range
Range = maximum value - minimum value

## Quartiles
- **Q1** (lower quartile): median of the lower half of the data (25th percentile)
- **Q2** (median): the middle value (50th percentile)
- **Q3** (upper quartile): median of the upper half (75th percentile)

## Interquartile Range (IQR)
IQR = Q3 - Q1

The IQR contains the middle 50% of the data and is not affected by outliers.

## Percentiles
The p-th percentile is the value below which p% of the data falls.`,

        content: `# Five-Number Summary

The five-number summary consists of:
1. **Minimum** value
2. **Q1** (lower quartile)
3. **Q2** (median)
4. **Q3** (upper quartile)
5. **Maximum** value

**Example:** Data (ordered): 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16
- Minimum = 2
- Q1 = (3 + 5)/2 = 4  (median of lower half: 2, 3, 5, 7)
- Q2 = 8 (median)
- Q3 = (12 + 14)/2 = 13  (median of upper half: 10, 12, 14, 16)
- Maximum = 16

## Box-and-Whisker Plot

A box-and-whisker plot is a diagram that displays the five-number summary.

How to draw:
1. Draw a number line.
2. Mark the minimum and maximum with vertical lines connected by "whiskers."
3. Draw a box from Q1 to Q3.
4. Draw a vertical line inside the box at the median (Q2).

### Reading a Box-and-Whisker Plot
- The box shows the middle 50% of the data (IQR).
- The left whisker represents the bottom 25%.
- The right whisker represents the top 25%.
- If the median is not centred in the box, the data is skewed.

### Identifying Outliers
An outlier is a value more than 1.5 * IQR below Q1 or above Q3.
Lower fence = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
Upper fence = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR`,

        content: `# Histograms, Frequency Polygons, and Ogives

## Histograms

A histogram displays the frequency of grouped (continuous) data using bars.

**Key features:**
- The x-axis shows class intervals (e.g. 0-10, 10-20, 20-30).
- The y-axis shows frequency.
- Bars are adjacent (no gaps) because the data is continuous.
- The height of each bar represents the frequency of that interval.

## Frequency Polygons

A frequency polygon is formed by connecting the midpoints of the tops of histogram bars with straight lines.

**Steps:**
1. Calculate the midpoint of each class interval.
2. Plot (midpoint, frequency) for each class.
3. Connect the points with straight lines.
4. Close the polygon by connecting to the x-axis at both ends (using the midpoints of the intervals before the first and after the last class).

## Ogives (Cumulative Frequency Curves)

An ogive shows the **cumulative frequency** (running total) plotted against the upper boundary of each class interval.

**Steps to draw an ogive:**
1. Create a cumulative frequency table.
2. Plot points at (upper class boundary, cumulative frequency).
3. Start at the lower boundary of the first class with cumulative frequency 0.
4. Connect the points with a smooth curve.

**Reading from an ogive:**
- The median is at the 50th percentile (n/2 on the y-axis).
- Q1 is at the 25th percentile (n/4).
- Q3 is at the 75th percentile (3n/4).
- Read across from the y-axis to the curve, then down to the x-axis.`,

## Basic Definitions

- **Experiment:** an action with uncertain outcomes (e.g. rolling a die).
- **Sample space (S):** the set of all possible outcomes.
- **Event (A):** a subset of the sample space.
- **n(S):** the number of outcomes in the sample space.
- **n(A):** the number of outcomes in event A.

## Theoretical Probability

**P(A) = n(A) / n(S)**

Probability always satisfies: 0 <= P(A) <= 1
- P(A) = 0 means the event is impossible.
- P(A) = 1 means the event is certain.

**Example:** Rolling a fair die. S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, n(S) = 6.
P(rolling a 3) = 1/6.
P(rolling an even number) = 3/6 = 1/2.

## Relative Frequency

Relative frequency = (number of times event occurred) / (total number of trials)

As the number of trials increases, relative frequency approaches theoretical probability. This is the **Law of Large Numbers**.

## Complementary Events

The complement of event A (written A') consists of all outcomes NOT in A.
**P(A') = 1 - P(A)**

**Example:** P(not rolling a 6) = 1 - 1/6 = 5/6.`,

        type: "text",
        order: 2,
        content: `# Venn Diagrams and Set Operations

## Venn Diagrams

A Venn diagram uses circles inside a rectangle to show relationships between events.
- The rectangle represents the sample space S.
- Each circle represents an event.
- Overlapping regions show outcomes in both events.

## Set Operations

- **A and B** (intersection): outcomes in BOTH A and B.
- **A or B** (union): outcomes in A OR B or both.
- **A'** (complement): outcomes NOT in A.

## Mutually Exclusive Events

Events A and B are **mutually exclusive** if they cannot happen at the same time.
- P(A and B) = 0
- Their Venn diagram circles do not overlap.

**Example:** Rolling a die: A = {1, 2}, B = {5, 6}. A and B are mutually exclusive.

## The Addition Rule

For ANY two events:
**P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)**

For **mutually exclusive** events (P(A and B) = 0):
**P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)**

## Example with Venn Diagram

In a class of 40 learners: 25 play soccer (S), 18 play cricket (C), and 10 play both.
- n(S only) = 25 - 10 = 15
- n(C only) = 18 - 10 = 8
- n(S and C) = 10
- n(neither) = 40 - 15 - 10 - 8 = 7

P(S or C) = P(S) + P(C) - P(S and C) = 25/40 + 18/40 - 10/40 = 33/40`,

        type: "text",

        content: `# Tree Diagrams

A tree diagram shows all possible outcomes of sequential events using branches.

## How to Draw
1. Draw branches for each outcome of the first event.
2. From each branch, draw branches for each outcome of the second event.
3. Write probabilities on each branch.
4. Multiply along branches to find the probability of each combined outcome.

## Example

A bag has 3 red and 2 blue balls. Two balls are drawn one at a time WITHOUT replacement.

First draw: P(R) = 3/5, P(B) = 2/5
Second draw (after R): P(R) = 2/4, P(B) = 2/4
Second draw (after B): P(R) = 3/4, P(B) = 1/4

Outcomes:
- P(R, R) = 3/5 * 2/4 = 6/20 = 3/10
- P(R, B) = 3/5 * 2/4 = 6/20 = 3/10
- P(B, R) = 2/5 * 3/4 = 6/20 = 3/10
- P(B, B) = 2/5 * 1/4 = 2/20 = 1/10

Check: 3/10 + 3/10 + 3/10 + 1/10 = 10/10 = 1. Correct.

# Contingency Tables (Two-Way Tables)

A contingency table organises data about two categorical variables into rows and columns.

## Example

| | Left-handed | Right-handed | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Male | 8 | 42 | 50 |
| Female | 12 | 38 | 50 |
| Total | 20 | 80 | 100 |

P(Left-handed) = 20/100 = 1/5
P(Female and Left-handed) = 12/100 = 3/25
P(Male or Left-handed) = P(Male) + P(Left) - P(Male and Left) = 50/100 + 20/100 - 8/100 = 62/100 = 31/50`,
